# üß† CSC148 ‚Äì Introduction to Computer Science II  
**University of Toronto | Python Data Structures & Algorithms**

This repository contains my implementations and notes for **CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science II** at the **University of Toronto**.  
The course focuses on **object-oriented programming, abstract data types (ADTs), and classic data structures and algorithms** implemented in **Python**.

## üìö Course Overview

CSC148 builds on CSC108 and introduces the **design, analysis, and implementation** of data structures and algorithms.  
Topics include:
- Object-oriented design and encapsulation
- Recursion and recursive structures
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
- Efficiency and complexity analysis
- Classic algorithms (searching, sorting, traversal)

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **BST.py** | Implementation of **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** supporting insertion, search, and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder). Demonstrates recursion and node-based structures. |
| **Doubly Linked List.py** | Doubly linked list with forward and backward traversal, insertion, deletion, and node pointer handling. |
| **Tree.py** | General **Tree ADT** implementation with recursive traversal, child-parent relationships, and applications for hierarchical data. |
| **graphs.py** | Graph representations (Adjacency List / Matrix), BFS, DFS, and path-finding algorithms. |
| **hashmaps.py** | Hash map (dictionary-like) data structure implementing hashing, collision handling (chaining), and resizing. |
| **link lists.py** | Singly linked list implementation demonstrating node references, traversal, and insertion/deletion operations. |
| **queue_1.py** | Queue ADT implemented with both **array-based** and **linked-list-based** approaches (FIFO principle). |
| **search.py** | Classic search algorithms: **Linear Search**, **Binary Search**, and their time complexities. |
| **sorting.py** | Implementation of sorting algorithms including **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** with complexity analysis. |
| **stack.py** | Stack ADT implementation using lists; demonstrates **LIFO** operations (push, pop, peek). |
| **README.md** | Course documentation and file overview (this file). |
